#### Pig Latin
Our publishing company has been asked to publish things in Pig Latin for our customers. We will need a Pig Latin translator that should take in text and translate it. Pig Latin is a joke variation of english where 2 rules apply:
Words starting with consonants have all leading consonants moved to the end of the word, and then “ay” is applied
Words starting with vowels have “way” appended to the end.
Ex: pig -> igpay, arrow -> arrowway

#### Styling Designs
Linked is a file titled mm_homepage.zip. In this zip file you will find index.html, styles.css, img and fonts folders, and a Mockups folder.
You goal is to make index.html render as closely to the pair of mockup images as you can, without modifying index.html in any way. You should be able to achieve this by exclusively updating styles.css.
